We are studying Courthouse Rock 
Courthouse Rock is a popular landmark in the Red River Gorge state park. You can reach Courthouse Rock by taking the Auxier Ridge. The rock is dome shaped. 
The Avenza mapping tool was very accurate in measuring my hiking movements, and distances. It was difficult to interpret this data due to the low resolution of our base-map image.
